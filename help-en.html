<p><b><a name="territories">Territories</a></b></p>

<p><u>Territory list</u></p>

<p>Here are all territories listed from new to old. To create a new territory, tap on the plus button and enter the name of the territory. It may be a house number, street name, some area, etc. Tap on a territory to enter it.</p>

<p>You may enter custom text notes in each territory: go to Info in the menu. Here you also find three dates: when the territory was taken, when the work ends (enter it manually), and the last visit.</p>

<p>In each territory background a histogram is displayed, with vertical lines representing a single household inside it, with the color associated to it.</p>

<p><u>Household list</u></p>

<p>In the simple list view, you may only change the item (household) order. In the settings, you may change the number of text rows to display. Tap on an item to edit its heading (usually number), change color, move, or delete.</p>

<p>In the grid view (hit button with four squares above) items are shown as buttons. Their layout may be configured in a more flexible way. Items may be moved, shifted, arranged in a custom way. To do this, long-press on the item (tap and hold). You may also change the number of rows and columns, change numeration direction (top-down or bottom-up, left to right or right to left). To do this, go to Layout in the menu. You may change size of the buttons in the program settings.</p>

<p>Note that the order and layout in list and grid views are configured separately. In other words, if you swapped two items in the grid view, they won't be swapped in the list view, and you should swap them there again. However, deletion an item in any view works for both views.</p>

<p>In any view swipe right or left to go to another screen inside a territory. It is convenient to place different streets, entrances, floors, etc. on different screens.</p>

<p>Tap on the plus button to add a household (usually appartment or house). It is possible to add a single or multiple households by entering number range.</p>

<p>Tap on a household to enter it.</p>

<p><u>Visit list</u></p>

<p>If you enter a household for the first time, you will be asked to create a new tenant in it by filling his/her description (sex, age, name, etc.). If at least one tenant is created, you will see a list of all visits (calls) from new to old. Each visit displays: icon symbolizing type of visit (N/A, normal, return, Bible study), date, time, description, literature placed.</a>

<p>"N/A" type is voluntary and used mostly when nobody is home. In this case the visit description will be hidden. In case of the first visit the household will retain gray color. You may add the tenant description, but the tenant itself will not be shown in the People section.</p>

<p>To add a new visit tap on the plus button. To edit an existing visit, just tap on it. To change the household color, tap on the palette icon in the upper right corner.</p>

<p>In case of the first visit the household will get a color automatically, depending in the type of the visit (normal, return, Bible study). Default colors are set in the program settings. If you assign Not Interested status to a tenant, the color becomes red.</p>

<p>You may create several tenants for a single household. To change tenants, swipe left or right.</p>

<p>Tap on the tenant button to edit his/her description, delete or assign Not Interested. Tenants with this status are displayed in the People section in gray color.</p>

<p><u>Editing visits</u></p>

<p>Inside the visit dialog you may enter any notes and change the visit type (N/A, normal, return, Bible study). Date and time are set automatically, though you may change them manually.</p>

<p>Return visits and studies are automatically tracked depending on the type of the visit you set. A Bible study is counted as a return visit as well. Several studies with a single tenant are counted as a single study.</p>

<p>If the box "Take from text" is checked, literature in statistics will be tracked according to templates in the text note. For example, if you put +m, one magazine will be tracked. These templates are custom and set in the program settings. For example, you may prefer [m] or (m) instead of +m.</p>

<p><b><a name="people">People</a></b></p>

<p>In this section all tenants from all territories are presented in a single list (except those with Not Interested status) in order of time of visit. The longer a person was visited last time, the higher he/she is in the list. Tap on a person to jump to his/her visit list.</p>

<p>You may also create a custom person without connection to any territory. To do that, tap on the plus button above. This is useful if you met someone in the street, informal service, have a Bible study outside your territory, etc.</p>

<p><b><a name="reports">Reports</a></b></p>

<p>All ministry statistics are displayed here by months. Each monthly report is presented as a list of all registered service sessions (tracked by the chronometer) with relevant data for each session: description, literature, return visits, studies, and service time. The "Total" field is where all sessions are summed up during the current month.</p>

<p>Statistics of placed literature and return visits for the final report ("Total" field) may be tracked in two modes: by service list or by visits. In the first case, only service sessions registed by the chronometer will be tracked. You may delete a person or territory, and their statistics will remain. However, if you forget to turn on the chronometer, you will lose the statistics (in this case just create a new service session and add the necessary statistic manually).</p>

<p>In the second case, all the placed literature and return visits (but not service time) will be tracked regardless of the chronometer. If you delete a tenant ot territory, their statistic will disappear from the reports. Use this mode if you don't want to use the chronometer due to some reason (say, you track time manually). However, in this case you won't be able to add custom statistics manually right in the chronometer.</p>

<p>Bible studies are a separate case: they are linked to people and are not saved in service sessions. Thus, switching tracking mode won't affect Bible study statistics.</p>

<p>Tap on the letter button to send the current month's statistic via e-mail or SMS (for example, to the congregation secretary).</p>

<p><b><a name="time">Chronometer</a></b></p>

<p>This section is where service time is tracked and sent to the report with its corresponding statistics. Tap on the Start button in the beginning of service, and Finish in the end. This time period with literature and return visits will be saved in the Reports section. If needed, you may alter the time with the help of plus and minus buttons (by tens of minutes). Chronometer works in the background, you may safely leave the program.</p>

<p>After the end of service you will be asked to enter its description (say, where you were, with whom, what publication was studied, etc.). This description is voluntary and may be skipped.</p>

<p>Chronometer is especially useful when you serve out of your territory (study, street, informal, etc.) and don't create any visits but need to track other statistics. In this case, start the chronometer, uncheck the box "Take from visits" and set the needed statistics below.</p>
